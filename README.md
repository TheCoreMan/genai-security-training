# GenAI Red Teaming Training

A comprehensive, self-paced training curriculum for security researchers focused on red teaming GenAI and AI/ML systems. This repository contains hands-on labs, theoretical content, and practical demonstrations of adversarial techniques.

## 🔴 What is GenAI Red Teaming?

**Red teaming for AI/ML goes far beyond traditional RAI (Responsible AI) testing.** While RAI focuses on fairness, bias, and ethical considerations, red teaming encompasses:

- **Adversarial Attacks**: Crafting inputs to fool models or extract sensitive information
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Identifying exploitable weaknesses in AI systems
- **Privacy Breaches**: Testing for data leakage and membership inference
- **Model Manipulation**: Poisoning, backdoors, and supply chain attacks
- **Evasion Techniques**: Bypassing safety guardrails and content filters
- **System-Level Exploits**: Prompt injection, jailbreaking, and serialization attacks

This training teaches **offensive security techniques** for AI systems, the same methods attackers use, so you can better defend against them.

**New to AI Security?** Start with our companion resource: [GenAI Essentials - LLM Security Notebook](https://github.com/schwartz1375/genai-essentials/blob/main/llm_security.ipynb) for foundational concepts before diving into this advanced curriculum.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd genai-security-training

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify installation (Optional and note all packages)
python -c "import torch, transformers, numpy, pandas; print('✅ Ready!')"
```

**Note**: Installation takes 10-15 minutes. Labs that need additional packages (like `textattack`, `adversarial-robustness-toolbox`, etc.) will automatically install them when you run the notebook.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Start with Module 1 to understand the foundations
