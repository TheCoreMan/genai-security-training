# Interpretability & Explainability Security

## Overview

Interpretability and explainability methods are designed to make AI systems more transparent and trustworthy. However, these same mechanisms can be exploited by adversaries to craft more effective attacks, evade detection, or manipulate explanations themselves. This document explores the security implications of interpretability.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand interpretability methods (SHAP, LIME, attention)
- Exploit explanations to guide adversarial attacks
- Manipulate explanations to hide malicious behavior
- Use interpretability for backdoor detection
- Design robust interpretability mechanisms

## Why Interpretability Matters for Security

### Dual Nature of Interpretability

**Benefits for Security**:
- Detect anomalous model behavior
- Identify backdoors and trojans
- Understand attack mechanisms
- Validate model decisions
- Support security auditing

**Risks for Security**:
- Reveals model vulnerabilities
- Enables targeted attacks
- Can be manipulated
- Creates false sense of security
- Increases attack surface

## Core Interpretability Methods

### 1. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

**Concept**: Game-theoretic approach to explain predictions


```python
import shap

# SHAP explains feature importance
explainer = shap.Explainer(model)
shap_values = explainer(X_test)

# Visualize feature contributions
shap.plots.waterfall(shap_values[0])
```

**Properties**:
- Theoretically grounded (Shapley values)
- Consistent and locally accurate
- Model-agnostic variants available
- Computationally expensive

**Security Implications**:
- Reveals which features model relies on
- Can guide feature-space attacks
- Shows model decision boundaries
- Exposes feature interactions

### 2. LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)

**Concept**: Approximate model locally with interpretable model

```python
from lime.lime_tabular import LimeTabularExplainer

explainer = LimeTabularExplainer(X_train, mode='classification')
explanation = explainer.explain_instance(x_test, model.predict_proba)
```

**Properties**:
- Model-agnostic
- Local approximation
- Fast computation
- Intuitive explanations

**Security Implications**:
- Local approximation can be fooled
- Reveals local decision boundaries
- Can be manipulated by adversary
- Unstable explanations

### 3. Attention Mechanisms

**Concept**: Visualize what model "pays attention to"

```python
# Transformer attention visualization
attention_weights = model.get_attention_weights(input_text)
visualize_attention(attention_weights, tokens)
```

**Security Implications**:
- Shows which tokens/features are important
- Guides adversarial perturbations
- Can be manipulated
- Reveals model focus areas

### 4. Gradient-Based Methods

**Concept**: Use gradients to explain predictions

```python
# Integrated Gradients
from captum.attr import IntegratedGradients

ig = IntegratedGradients(model)
attributions = ig.attribute(input_tensor, target=class_idx)
```

**Methods**:
- Saliency maps
- Integrated gradients
- GradCAM
- Guided backpropagation

## Explanation-Guided Attacks

### Attack 1: SHAP-Guided Adversarial Examples

**Concept**: Use SHAP values to identify most important features, then perturb them

```python
def shap_guided_attack(model, x, target_class, epsilon=0.1):
    """
    Use SHAP to guide adversarial perturbation
    """
    # Get SHAP values
    explainer = shap.Explainer(model)
    shap_values = explainer(x.reshape(1, -1))
    
    # Get feature importance
    importance = np.abs(shap_values.values[0])
    
    # Perturb most important features
    x_adv = x.copy()
    top_features = np.argsort(importance)[-5:]  # Top 5 features
    
    for feat_idx in top_features:
        # Perturb in direction that changes prediction
        if shap_values.values[0][feat_idx] > 0:
            x_adv[feat_idx] -= epsilon
        else:
            x_adv[feat_idx] += epsilon
    
    return x_adv
```

**Advantages**:
- Targets most influential features
- Requires fewer perturbations
- Higher success rate
- More efficient than blind attacks

**Example Results**:
```
Blind attack: 100 queries, 60% success
SHAP-guided: 20 queries, 85% success
```

### Attack 2: LIME-Based Feature Manipulation

**Concept**: Use LIME to understand local decision boundary, then craft adversarial examples

```python
def lime_guided_attack(model, x, target_class):
    """
    Use LIME to guide adversarial example generation
    """
    explainer = LimeTabularExplainer(X_train, mode='classification')
    explanation = explainer.explain_instance(x, model.predict_proba)
    
    # Get feature weights
    feature_weights = dict(explanation.as_list())
    
    # Perturb features with highest weights
    x_adv = x.copy()
    for feat_name, weight in sorted(feature_weights.items(), 
                                     key=lambda x: abs(x[1]), 
                                     reverse=True)[:3]:
        feat_idx = int(feat_name.split('_')[0])
        # Perturb opposite to weight direction
        x_adv[feat_idx] -= np.sign(weight) * 0.1
    
    return x_adv
```

### Attack 3: Attention-Guided Text Attacks

**Concept**: Target tokens with high attention weights

```python
def attention_guided_text_attack(model, text, tokenizer):
    """
    Use attention to guide text adversarial attacks
    """
    # Get attention weights
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')
    outputs = model(**inputs, output_attentions=True)
    attention = outputs.attentions[-1].mean(dim=1)[0]  # Average over heads
    
    # Find tokens with highest attention
    tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(inputs['input_ids'][0])
    attention_scores = attention.mean(dim=0).detach().numpy()
    
    # Target high-attention tokens for replacement
    top_indices = np.argsort(attention_scores)[-5:]
    
    # Replace with synonyms or adversarial tokens
    adversarial_text = text
    for idx in top_indices:
        token = tokens[idx]
        if token not in ['[CLS]', '[SEP]', '[PAD]']:
            # Replace with adversarial token
            adversarial_text = adversarial_text.replace(
                token, get_adversarial_synonym(token)
            )
    
    return adversarial_text
```

### Attack 4: Gradient-Based Explanation Attacks

**Concept**: Use gradient information from explanations

```python
def gradient_explanation_attack(model, x, target_class):
    """
    Use gradient-based explanations to craft attacks
    """
    from captum.attr import IntegratedGradients
    
    ig = IntegratedGradients(model)
    attributions = ig.attribute(x, target=target_class)
    
    # Perturb features with highest attributions
    perturbation = torch.sign(attributions) * 0.1
    x_adv = x + perturbation
    
    return x_adv
```

## Manipulating Explanations

### Attack: Explanation Poisoning

**Concept**: Train model to give misleading explanations while maintaining accuracy

```python
def train_with_explanation_poisoning(model, X_train, y_train, 
                                      target_explanation):
    """
    Train model to produce specific explanations
    """
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())
    
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for x, y in dataloader:
            # Standard prediction loss
            pred = model(x)
            pred_loss = criterion(pred, y)
            
            # Explanation loss - force specific explanation
            shap_values = compute_shap(model, x)
            explanation_loss = mse_loss(shap_values, target_explanation)
            
            # Combined loss
            total_loss = pred_loss + lambda_exp * explanation_loss
            
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            total_loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
```

**Impact**:
- Model maintains accuracy
- Explanations are misleading
- Hides true decision logic
- Evades interpretability-based detection

### Attack: Fooling LIME

**Concept**: Create model that behaves differently on LIME's perturbed samples

```python
class AdversarialModel:
    """
    Model that detects LIME perturbations and behaves differently
    """
    def __init__(self, base_model):
        self.base_model = base_model
        
    def predict(self, X):
        # Detect if input looks like LIME perturbation
        if self.is_lime_perturbation(X):
            # Return misleading prediction
            return self.misleading_prediction(X)
        else:
            # Normal prediction
            return self.base_model.predict(X)
    
    def is_lime_perturbation(self, X):
        # LIME creates many similar samples
        # Detect statistical patterns
        return check_perturbation_pattern(X)
```

## Using Interpretability for Defense

### Defense 1: Backdoor Detection via Interpretability

**Concept**: Backdoors show unusual activation patterns

```python
def detect_backdoor_via_interpretability(model, X_clean, X_backdoor):
    """
    Use interpretability to detect backdoors
    """
    # Get explanations for clean and backdoor samples
    explainer = shap.Explainer(model)
    
    shap_clean = explainer(X_clean)
    shap_backdoor = explainer(X_backdoor)
    
    # Compare explanation distributions
    clean_importance = np.abs(shap_clean.values).mean(axis=0)
    backdoor_importance = np.abs(shap_backdoor.values).mean(axis=0)
    
    # Backdoors often rely on specific features
    difference = np.abs(clean_importance - backdoor_importance)
    
    # High difference indicates potential backdoor
    if difference.max() > threshold:
        return True, np.argmax(difference)
    return False, None
```

**Techniques**:
- Activation clustering
- Neural Cleanse
- Spectral signatures
- Feature importance analysis

### Defense 2: Adversarial Example Detection

**Concept**: Adversarial examples have unusual explanations

```python
def detect_adversarial_via_explanation(model, x, x_train):
    """
    Detect adversarial examples using explanation consistency
    """
    # Get explanation for test sample
    explainer = shap.Explainer(model)
    shap_test = explainer(x.reshape(1, -1))
    
    # Get explanations for similar training samples
    similar_indices = find_similar_samples(x, x_train, k=10)
    shap_train = explainer(x_train[similar_indices])
    
    # Compare explanation consistency
    consistency_score = compute_explanation_similarity(
        shap_test, shap_train
    )
    
    # Low consistency indicates adversarial
    return consistency_score < threshold
```

### Defense 3: Model Validation

**Concept**: Use interpretability to validate model behavior

```python
def validate_model_behavior(model, X_test, expected_features):
    """
    Validate that model uses expected features
    """
    explainer = shap.Explainer(model)
    shap_values = explainer(X_test)
    
    # Check if model uses expected features
    feature_importance = np.abs(shap_values.values).mean(axis=0)
    top_features = np.argsort(feature_importance)[-10:]
    
    # Validate against expected features
    unexpected_features = set(top_features) - set(expected_features)
    
    if len(unexpected_features) > 0:
        print(f"Warning: Model uses unexpected features: {unexpected_features}")
        return False
    return True
```

## Advanced Topics

### 1. Mechanistic Interpretability

**Concept**: Understand internal model mechanisms, not just input-output

```python
# Analyze specific neurons or circuits
def analyze_neuron_behavior(model, neuron_idx, X_test):
    """
    Understand what specific neuron detects
    """
    activations = get_neuron_activations(model, neuron_idx, X_test)
    
    # Find inputs that maximally activate neuron
    top_activating = X_test[np.argsort(activations)[-10:]]
    
    # Visualize what neuron responds to
    visualize_neuron_behavior(top_activating)
```

**Applications**:
- Circuit analysis
- Feature visualization
- Understanding model internals
- Identifying security-critical components

### 2. Counterfactual Explanations

**Concept**: "What would need to change for different prediction?"

```python
def generate_counterfactual(model, x, target_class):
    """
    Find minimal change to achieve target prediction
    """
    x_cf = x.copy()
    
    # Optimize to find minimal perturbation
    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        pred = model.predict(x_cf)
        if pred == target_class:
            break
        
        # Gradient-based optimization
        grad = compute_gradient(model, x_cf, target_class)
        x_cf -= learning_rate * grad
    
    # Return minimal change
    return x_cf, np.linalg.norm(x_cf - x)
```

**Security Implications**:
- Reveals decision boundaries
- Guides adversarial examples
- Shows model vulnerabilities

### 3. Concept-Based Explanations

**Concept**: Explain in terms of high-level concepts

```python
# TCAV (Testing with Concept Activation Vectors)
def compute_concept_importance(model, concept_examples, x):
    """
    How important is a concept for this prediction?
    """
    # Train linear classifier for concept
    cav = train_concept_vector(model, concept_examples)
    
    # Compute directional derivative
    sensitivity = compute_directional_derivative(model, x, cav)
    
    return sensitivity
```

## Robust Interpretability

### Challenge: Explanation Instability

**Problem**: Small input changes cause large explanation changes

```python
def measure_explanation_stability(model, x, epsilon=0.01):
    """
    Measure how stable explanations are
    """
    explainer = shap.Explainer(model)
    
    # Original explanation
    shap_original = explainer(x.reshape(1, -1))
    
    # Perturbed explanations
    stabilities = []
    for _ in range(num_trials):
        x_perturbed = x + np.random.normal(0, epsilon, x.shape)
        shap_perturbed = explainer(x_perturbed.reshape(1, -1))
        
        # Measure similarity
        similarity = cosine_similarity(
            shap_original.values, 
            shap_perturbed.values
        )
        stabilities.append(similarity)
    
    return np.mean(stabilities)
```

### Solution: Robust Explanation Methods

```python
def robust_shap_explanation(model, x, num_samples=100):
    """
    Compute robust SHAP values via averaging
    """
    explainer = shap.Explainer(model)
    
    shap_values_list = []
    for _ in range(num_samples):
        # Add small noise
        x_noisy = x + np.random.normal(0, 0.01, x.shape)
        shap_values = explainer(x_noisy.reshape(1, -1))
        shap_values_list.append(shap_values.values)
    
    # Average over noisy samples
    robust_shap = np.mean(shap_values_list, axis=0)
    return robust_shap
```

## Case Studies

### Case 1: SHAP-Guided Credit Card Fraud

**Scenario**: Attacker uses SHAP to understand fraud detection model

```python
# Attacker's approach
explainer = shap.Explainer(fraud_model)
shap_values = explainer(fraudulent_transaction)

# Identify which features trigger detection
important_features = get_top_features(shap_values)

# Modify transaction to avoid detection
modified_transaction = fraudulent_transaction.copy()
for feature in important_features:
    # Adjust to look legitimate
    modified_transaction[feature] = legitimate_value

# Evade detection
prediction = fraud_model.predict(modified_transaction)
# Result: Fraud not detected
```

### Case 2: Attention-Based Spam Filter Evasion

**Scenario**: Spammer uses attention to evade filter

```python
# Analyze what spam filter pays attention to
attention_weights = spam_filter.get_attention(spam_email)

# Identify trigger words
trigger_words = get_high_attention_tokens(attention_weights)

# Replace with synonyms or obfuscation
evasive_email = spam_email
for word in trigger_words:
    evasive_email = evasive_email.replace(word, get_synonym(word))

# Evade filter
is_spam = spam_filter.predict(evasive_email)
# Result: Classified as legitimate
```

### Case 3: Backdoor Detection Success

**Scenario**: Security team uses interpretability to find backdoor

```python
# Analyze model behavior on suspicious samples
explainer = shap.Explainer(model)

# Compare clean vs suspicious
shap_clean = explainer(clean_samples)
shap_suspicious = explainer(suspicious_samples)

# Identify unusual feature importance
difference = analyze_explanation_difference(shap_clean, shap_suspicious)

# Backdoor detected: specific pixel pattern
backdoor_trigger = identify_trigger(difference)
print(f"Backdoor found: {backdoor_trigger}")
```
